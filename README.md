###### Notes

- This resource pack is an add-on resource pack which modifies the vanilla textures while still keeping the original look and feel of Minecraft. It also adds alot of quality of  life improvements to the game. Think of it as an add-on which adds miscellaneous features.

- If you're using OptiFine make sure you have the options Custom Items and Alternate Blocks ON.

- This does not support Minecraft Versions 1.7 - 1.12.2 since the resource pack needs to be structured in a different way and alot of textures needs to be renamed. But an 1.7 - 1.12.2 version is coming soon.

- This resource pack will be bundled with 0tx.org aswell as 9tx.org when they release.

- Having missing textures or bugs? Open an issue on the issues tab or contact me through discord, forums or on the servers.
